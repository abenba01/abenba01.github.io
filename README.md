THIS README IS FOR COMP20 ASSIGNMENT 1: YOUR PORTFOLIO

NO WARNINGS OR ERRORS OCCURRED UPON SUBMITTING INDEX.HTML, BIO.HTML, RESUME.HTML, AND STYLE.CSS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE W3 REVIEW PAGES.

ALL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, HOWEVER I DO NOT KNOW WHY MY LINKS ARE UNDERLINED. I ALSO EXPERIENCED TROUBLE PUSHING TO GIT AT TIMES, SO I EDITED THROUGH GITHUB.

I DID NOT COLLABORATE WITH ANYONE WHILE WORKING ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. HOWEVER, I DID GO TO A TUFTSMAKE WORKSHOP LAST SEMESTER THAT TAUGHT ME THE BASICS OF CSS AND HTML, SO I USED MY ORIGINAL CODE FROM THAT WORKSHOP.

THIS ASSIGNMENT TOOK ME APPROXIMATELY 3 OR 4 HOURS IN TOTAL. A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS SPENT WRESTLING WITH GIT/GITHUB.
