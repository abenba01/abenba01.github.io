THIS README IS FOR COMP20 ASSIGNMENT 1: YOUR PORTFOLIO

NO WARNINGS OR ERRORS OCCURRED UPON SUBMITTING INDEX.HTML, BIO.HTML, RESUME.HTML, AND STYLE.CSS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE W3 REVIEW PAGES.

ALL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, HOWEVER THE COLORS ATTRIBUTED TO H4 WILL NOT SHOW ON THE WEBSITE FOR REASONS I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT. I ALSO EXPERIENCED TROUBLE PUSHING TO GIT AT TIMES, SO I EDITED THROUGH GITHUB.

I DID NOT COLLABORATE WITH ANYONE WHILE WORKING ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. HOWEVER, I DID GO TO A TUFTSMAKE WORKSHOP LAST SEMESTER THAT TAUGHT ME THE BASICS OF CSS AND HTML, SO I USED MY ORIGINAL CODE FROM THAT WORKSHOP.

THIS ASSIGNMENT TOOK ME APPROXIMATELY 3 OR 4 HOURS IN TOTAL. A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS SPENT WRESTLING WITH GIT/GITHUB.
